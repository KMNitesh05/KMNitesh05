I have a broad range of interests in Computational Chemistry, Interfacial Chemistry, and Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and its applications in Machine Learning method development. I write codes and develop theories for the analysis of complex chemical data ranging from phase space to trajectory space. I have expertize in topological data analysis, statistical mechanics, and method development for the analysis of complex chemical data. I develop new chemical-descriptors using the tools of Applied Mathematics such as Network-Theory, Algebraic-Topology and free energy methods. At PNNL, I studied the aggregation behavior of organic flow battery electrolytes within the Physical Biosciences group. Currently, I am affiliated with the Chemical Sciences Division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, specializing in fundamental chemistry at interfaces and supramolecular systems. My career aspirations are to conduct research in the analysis of complex data with AI applications and to teach and train students. I am committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and discrimination-free environment. I believe in empathy, shared knowledge and shared opportunities for everyone, fostering an inclusive environment where people can thrive and contribute to the collective progress.
